# Ledgerly demo howto

Presenter run-of-show for the **101** and **201** tracks, not a course. Every step stands on its own, so you can start anywhere. You still review each result before it ships.

Ledgerly is a small, fictional demo app. It exists to give Grok Build enablement steps a visible surface: code to read, a UI to inspect, a scoped error to fix, and tests to verify. The data is synthetic. Avery Quinn is the operator, the only plan prices are Starter **$49**, Growth **$99**, and Scale **$249**, and the clock is frozen at **23 August 2026** so every run is repeatable.

The pastes below match the copy-paste blocks on `/runbooks/101` and `/runbooks/201`. Each beat is independent; jump directly to any step.

## Jump menu

The 101 track has three sections. Open `/runbooks/101` and copy a card for any beat.

1. **What is Grok Build?** — [Ask](#ask), [Plan](#plan), [Propose](#propose), [Build in Agent mode](#build-in-agent-mode), [Debug](#debug), check the models
2. **How do I work with an agent?** — allowlist, verify the email feature, redact, stop, interrupt and steer, continue to the end, review diffs, restore from a checkpoint
3. **How do I govern my agent?** — [create a rule](#create-a-rule), create a skill, [Canvas](#canvas), [MCP / Figma](#mcp--figma)

The 201 track has four sections. Open `/runbooks/201` and copy a card for any beat.

1. **How do you manage context?** — rename agents, Ask DDD, check context usage, compare agents, ask across chats
2. **How do you standardize agent behavior?** — [create-api skill](#create-api-skill), promote it
3. **How do you connect an agent to external tools?** — [private Linear team](#create-the-private-linear-team-manual), Linear MCP, list open issues, import plugin from disk
4. **How do you parallelize a task?** — [open a new agent](#open-the-plan), resolve-dispute plan, `/multitask`, Canvas subagent progress, ledgerly-reviewer check

## How to narrate

For a novice audience, narrate each step in this order:

- **Before:** "Here is the task and the boundary I am giving Grok Build."
- **During:** "Grok Build is reading, editing, or checking. I can inspect each action."
- **After:** "Here is the evidence. I decide whether the result ships."

Then add the engineering point: why the task is hard, what Grok Build takes on, and why the evidence matters. Do not read prompts aloud. State the intent, paste from the card, then narrate what changed in plain language.

Use these definitions when the audience is new:

- **Ask:** reads and explains; it does not edit.
- **OpenSpec:** the plan lives in the repo. `/opsx-explore` thinks, `/opsx-propose` writes `openspec/changes/<id>/`, `/opsx-apply` builds against it.
- **Agent:** can inspect, edit, and run checks within the boundary you give it.
- **Rule:** an always-on project guardrail.
- **Skill:** a reusable set of instructions for a kind of task.

---

## Before you start

```bash
npm i
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db seed
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:43173**. Or ask an agent to run the `start-ledgerly` skill — it starts on 43173 and seeds only when the database is empty.

Check shipped state:

- `npm test` is **1 failed / 33 passed**; the sole failure is `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts`
- [http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043](http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043) shows **Suggested credit $400.00** in red, above the Scale price of **$249**
- The deprecated v1 route returns the $400 claim; v2, the domain helper, and the seed store the correct $249 credit
- Accept credit / Decline are disabled — that unfinished resolution UI is separate from the planted API-version error
- Invoice and dispute status pills write `?state=` while the pages read `status` — clicking Overdue / Needs review does not filter. That is a planted UI seam, not a second red test. Restore it with the scripted reset.

If the credit reads $249.00 or the suite is all green, a prior run switched the client to v2. If status pills filter the list, a prior run renamed `state` to `status`. Run:

```bash
npm run demo:reset
```

Then complete only the remaining MCP cleanup reported by the script. Empty dashboard: `npm run db:reset`.

### Create the private Linear team (manual)

Linear MCP cannot create teams. Do this in the Linear UI **before** the 201 MCP section, on the presenter’s account only.

1. Open Linear → **Settings → Teams → New team**.
2. Name it for this operator only (example: `{displayName}-field-demos`).
3. Turn on **Make team private**. Team key can be **LY**. Confirm it at `https://linear.app/<workspace>/settings/teams/LY`.
4. Members: **only you**. Do not add any other team.
5. In Grok Build, run `stage-linear`. That skill creates or reconciles project `ce-field-demos` on this team with the three Fieldnote issues plus the nine Collections Command Center slices, tagged as that feature.

`stage-linear` never guesses the team — it lists your private teams and asks you to **confirm the exact one** before writing, so any team name works. `reset-demo-state` uses the same confirmation, then cancels the recorded issues and cancels the project (issues stay linked; the team is retained).

Do not skip the private-team step. A project on a public team is visible to that team.

---

## The demo error (2 min)

**Open:** [dsp_1043](http://127.0.0.1:43173/disputes/dsp_1043). The dashboard and Collections page are optional context.

**Do:** Point at **Suggested credit $400.00**, then **Scale catalog price $249.00**.

**Why:** One concrete error keeps the demo easy to follow. **Benefit:** Every enablement step can use the same visible example. **Why it matters:** The audience can focus on how Grok Build works instead of learning a product.

**Say — novice version:**

> Ledgerly is a fictional billing app we use for this demo. It contains one known error on purpose. This invoice costs $249, but the dispute claims $400. The current v2 API caps the suggested credit at $249. The page still calls deprecated v1, which returns the $400 claim. That is why the page shows a red warning and one test is red.

**How the error correlates:**

| Layer | File | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demo data | `prisma/seed.ts` | `dsp_1043` claims $400 against `inv_1043`, a $249 Scale invoice |
| Correct domain logic | `lib/dispute-credit.ts` | Caps suggested credit at the catalog plan price |
| Versioned APIs | `app/api/v1/disputes/[id]/suggested-credit/route.ts`, `app/api/v2/disputes/[id]/suggested-credit/route.ts` | v1 returns the $400 claim for compatibility; v2 returns $249 |
| Faulty client selection | `lib/disputes/suggested-credit-api.ts` | Selects deprecated v1, so the UI displays $400 |
| Expected behavior | `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts` | Expects the client to select v2 |

**Look for:** Red **Suggested credit $400.00**, copy stating it came from v1 and is above **$249.00**, and disabled Accept / Decline buttons. Those buttons are a separate unfinished seam; do not confuse them with the API-version error. Status pills on `/invoices` and `/disputes` are a third seam: they write `state=` so a click does not filter.

---

## Ask

**Open:** Grok Build chat in **Ask** mode. Leave the app on the dashboard or the dispute.

**Why:** Unfamiliar repos are expensive to learn. **Benefit:** Ask explains from source without editing. **Why it matters:** Engineers build confidence before acting.

**Paste** (same block as the first-prompt card):

```text
What are Ledgerly's only plan prices, and which seeded invoices are overdue? Cite lib/plans.ts, prisma/seed.ts, and prisma/extra-accounts.ts.

Explain the dispute flow end to end. What is intentionally unfinished? Cite the resolve helper, the resolve API route, and the dispute page. Do not edit any files.
```

**Look for:** Citations to `lib/plans.ts`, `prisma/seed.ts`, and `prisma/extra-accounts.ts`; the resolve stub named separately from the API-version error; no edits.

---

## Plan

**Open:** Agent chat. Not Plan mode — the plan is an OpenSpec change in the repo. **Why:** Mapping the approach first keeps the change scoped, and the spec outlives the chat.

**Paste:**

```text
/opsx-explore I want a new feature to update the customer email in the invoice detail customer card. Don’t implement email validation.
```

**Look for:** Explore reads `app/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`, names the customer card as the only surface, and defers validation. It writes nothing until you confirm.

---

## Propose

**Why:** The proposal, design, delta spec, and tasks are files you can review and diff.

**Paste:**

```text
/opsx-propose invoice-detail-email
```

**Look for:** `openspec/changes/invoice-detail-email/` with `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/invoice-customer-email/spec.md`, and `tasks.md`. Scenarios are Given/When/Then. Non-goals name email-format validation and the catalog. No product code changed. Then:

```bash
npx openspec validate --changes --strict
```

Record it for reset:

```bash
npm run demo:session -- record project-path openspec/changes/invoice-detail-email
```

---

## Build in Agent mode

**Open:** Agent (the default). Keep [inv_1048](http://127.0.0.1:43173/invoices/inv_1048) visible.

**Why:** End-to-end work crosses layers. **Benefit:** Agent edits and verifies against the spec you accepted. **Why it matters:** The boundary is the change, not the prompt.

**Paste:**

```text
/opsx-apply invoice-detail-email
```

**Look for:** Edits stay on the invoice detail customer card. Tasks tick off in `tasks.md`. No email-format validation. The customer name and `.example` address stay on the Fieldnote book. Open the invoice and change the email.

---

## Debug

**Open:** Debug mode. **Why:** Verify a change and investigate any failure with runtime evidence.

**Paste:**

```text
/debug the failing test
```

**Look for:** A hypothesis, an instrumented check, and a fix grounded in the actual failure.

---

## Create a rule

**Why:** Repeating standards in prompts is fragile. **Benefit:** A rule is always on for this project.

**Paste:**

```text
/create-rule Future code must never call /api/v1/disputes/*/suggested-credit. It must use /api/v2/disputes/*/suggested-credit. Create the project rule at .cursor/rules/suggested-credit-api-v2.mdc and show me the file before I keep it.
```

**Look for:** A proposed project rule under `.cursor/rules/`. This is a live manual beat; do not add the rule to the shipped repository.

Record it for reset:

```bash
npm run demo:session -- record project-path .cursor/rules/suggested-credit-api-v2.mdc
```

---

## Canvas

**Why:** Some results are easier to show than tell. **Benefit:** Canvas renders an interactive artifact next to the chat.

**Paste:**

```text
Create a canvas explaining what we did today.
```

---

## MCP / Figma

**Why:** Grok Build can drive external tools through MCP. **Benefit:** Generate slides for a showcase without leaving the editor.

Enable a Figma MCP server: **Customize > MCP > Figma**, then:

```text
Create three slides in Figma Slides outlining how I used Grok Build to develop a new feature. I want to use this as part of my demo showcase.
```

---

## Verify

**Paste:**

```text
Run npm test and report which tests passed and which failed. Do not edit any files.

On a clean tree, npm test is 1 failed / 33 passed. The sole red test is tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts because the client intentionally selects deprecated v1. Do not change the test, either route, or the seed.
```

**If the client migration ran:** `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts` should be green and dsp_1043 should show **$249** from v2, with both routes intact.

**If no migration ran:** `npm test` should remain **1 failed / 33 passed**. That is shipped state, not failed setup.

**Land:** A green check is evidence, not permission to merge. The presenter remains accountable.

---

## Close

**Say:**

> I reviewed the result. Now I am resetting the demo app so the next session starts with the same planted v1 client, the same $400 UI result, the same expected red test, and status pills that still write `state=`.

**Do:** Ask the agent to run `reset-demo-state`, or:

```bash
npm run demo:reset
```

**Then:** complete only the script's reported Figma, Cursor user-rule, or Linear MCP actions. The script resets files, recorded rules/skills, Canvas, branches, SQLite, and port 43173.

**Shipped state again:** suggested credit **$400.00** from v1 on dsp_1043, v2 and stored credit **$249.00**, suite **1 failed / 33 passed**, status pills still writing `state=`.

---

## The 201 track

Open `/runbooks/201`. Four section tabs match the Outline Show headings. Copy a card; Do text and prompts are on the card.

### How do you manage context?

Rename two agents (`/rename-chat Agent 1 All`, `/rename-chat Agent 2 Target`). Ask each for domain-driven design (whole app vs `@invoice-table.tsx`). Go to Agent 1 All chat. Select the Context Usage indicator below the chat. Go to Agent 2 Target. Select the Context Usage indicator below the chat. Compare agents: Agent 1 maps all the domains in the whole codebase. Agent 2 maps half of the domains based on the targeted context. Then ask across chats:

```text
/ask what is the domain driven design of the application.
```

```text
/ask what is the domain driven design of the @invoice-table.tsx
```

```text
/ask @Agent 1 All Does refactoring the table change anything across all contexts?
```

### How do you standardize agent behavior?

#### Create-api skill

```text
/create-skill for how to create a new API. Follow the standards in this repo. This is a personal skill named create-api.
```

Open the skill in `~/.cursor/skills`, then promote it:

```text
Promote the create-api skill to this project.
```

Open the project skill in `.cursor/skills`. Explore the other project skills for this repository, such as add-dashboard-widget, draft-collection-email, or write-prisma-query.

Record both leftovers for reset:

```bash
npm run demo:session -- record skill "$HOME/.cursor/skills/create-api"
npm run demo:session -- record project-path .cursor/skills/create-api
```

### How do you connect an agent to external tools?

Create the private Linear team by hand first ([steps above](#create-the-private-linear-team-manual)): Settings → Teams → New team, **Make team private**, members = you only. Then run `stage-linear`.

Review MCP servers in Customize → MCPs. Enable the Linear MCP server. Check the MCP allowlist under Settings → Agents → Execution and Approvals. Then:

```text
List the open issues from our issue tracker.
```

Add the plugin from the local repository (Customize → Plugins → Add → From Local Repository, then `plugins/standard-bug-fix`). Go to Customize → Plugins → Personal. Select Add to enable the “Standard bug fix” plugin. Show that the plugin has skills, rules, and MCP server. Then:

```text
Work on a standard bug fix for the issue where clicking overdue does not filter.
```

### How do you parallelize a task?

#### Open the plan

Open a new agent. Then open `.cursor/plans/resolve-dispute.md`, `.cursor/agents/ledgerly-reviewer.md`, and `.cursor/skills/dispatch-subagents/SKILL.md`. Then:

```text
/multitask @resolve-dispute.md
```

```text
Update Canvas with subagent progress and models used. Make a list of worktree conflicts as you encounter them.
```

```text
ledgerly-reviewer check my work
```

## Do not

- Invent a fourth price, ARR, or a real customer
- "Correct" the $400 claim on dsp_1043 or the seed
- Use Plan mode or `/plan` in the Plan beat — the plan is the OpenSpec change
- Archive or sync an OpenSpec change unless the operator asks
- Touch `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts` to make the migration pass
- Delete or change either suggested-credit API route
- Commit a KPI restyle to `main`
- Treat a green test as a ship decision
