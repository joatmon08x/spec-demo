# Ledgerly

Fictional B2B billing ops. Fieldnote Workspace. Operator **Avery Quinn**. Catalog is Starter **$49**, Growth **$99**, Scale **$249**. Demo clock is frozen at **23 August 2026**. Synthetic data only — no real companies.

Use it for the jumpable Grok Build **101** and **201** tracks. Copy-paste prompts live on `/runbooks/101` and `/runbooks/201`; the presenter run-of-show and speaker notes are `demo-howto.md`.

## Run

Node 20. Nothing else global.

```bash
npm i
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db seed
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:43173**. Or ask an agent to run the `start-ledgerly` skill — it starts the app on 43173 and seeds only when the database is missing or empty.

`npm test` is **1 failed / 33 passed** on a clean tree — `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts` is the planted API-version bug. The UI shows the deprecated v1 result of $400 for `dsp_1043`; v2 and the stored credit correctly cap at the $249 Scale price. Status pills on Invoices and Disputes write `state=` while the pages read `status`, so clicking a filter does not change the list — that is a separate planted UI seam, not a second red test. Reset a demo with `npm run demo:reset` first; `reset-demo-state` only finishes reported MCP cleanup. Use `npm run db:reset` only for data.

## App

Dashboard, Invoices, Collections, Disputes, Runbooks, Settings. Extra book accounts are in `prisma/extra-accounts.ts`.

| Demo hook | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Runbook beats | `/runbooks/101` and `/runbooks/201` (`/workflows` and `/analysis` redirect to 101) |
| `/loop` job | `POST` then `GET` `/api/demo/job` (~45s, not written to SQLite) |
| Agents | `.cursor/agents/` — `ledgerly-reviewer`, `api-instrumenter`, `dispute-verifier` |
| Skills | `.cursor/skills/` — run the demo, stage Linear, or pick a Cursor workflow |
| OpenSpec | `openspec/` — last 101 beat: `/opsx-explore` → `/opsx-propose` → Linear issue; `npm run openspec:validate` |
| Disk plugin | `plugins/standard-bug-fix/` — add from local repository; `/standard-bug-fix`, Linear MCP |
| Presenter script | `demo-howto.md` — the 101 and 201 run-of-show |

## Starter prompts

Ask:

```text
What are Ledgerly's only plan prices, and which seeded invoices are overdue? Cite lib/plans.ts, prisma/seed.ts, and prisma/extra-accounts.ts.

Explain the dispute flow end to end. What is intentionally unfinished? Cite the resolve helper, the resolve API route, and the dispute page. Do not edit any files.
```

Cmd-K on the settings description default:

```text
Rewrite this input's default value as one calm sentence explaining that the demo clock is frozen on 23 August 2026 so overdue math never drifts during a meeting. Keep it under 15 words.
```

Agent — suggested-credit API migration:

```text
Diagnose why dsp_1043 shows a $400 suggested credit even though v2 caps it at $249. Switch lib/disputes/suggested-credit-api.ts from v1 to v2. Preserve both API routes, the $400 dispute claim, and tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts. Run the relevant tests and verify the page shows $249 from v2.
```

Then create the guardrail live:

```text
/create-rule Future code must never call /api/v1/disputes/*/suggested-credit. It must use /api/v2/disputes/*/suggested-credit. Create the project rule at .cursor/rules/suggested-credit-api-v2.mdc and show me the file before I keep it.
```

Design Mode on the dashboard KPI cards:

```text
Restyle the four KPI cards on this dashboard using only the existing design tokens in app/globals.css: a soft indigo accent on each card, stronger emphasis on the value, and a subtle hover lift. No new hex colors, no layout rewrite, no data or price changes — $49, $99, and $249 stay exactly as rendered. Touch components/kpi-card.tsx, and app/page.tsx only if you must. Two files max, nothing under lib/ or tests/. Show me the diff — I am undoing this after the demo.
```

## The 101 track

Open `/runbooks/101`, copy a card, and paste it in Grok Build. You still review the result.

1. **What is Grok Build?** — Ask, Plan, Build in Agent mode, Debug, and check the models.
2. **How do I work with an agent?** — Run Mode allowlist, verify the email feature, redact, stop, interrupt and steer, continue to the end, review diffs, restore from a checkpoint.
3. **How do I govern my agent?** — create and test a rule, create and test a skill, Canvas, MCP / Linear in two steps: `/opsx-explore` the next feature, then `/opsx-propose` it and file one Linear issue.

## The 201 track

Open `/runbooks/201`, copy a card, and paste it in Grok Build. You still review the result.

1. **How do you manage context?** — rename agents, Ask DDD (whole app vs `@invoice-table.tsx`), check context usage, compare agents, ask across chats.
2. **How do you standardize agent behavior?** — personal create-api skill, promote it to the project.
3. **How do you connect an agent to external tools?** — Linear MCP, MCP allowlist, list open issues from the issue tracker, add `plugins/standard-bug-fix` from the local repository, enable the Standard bug fix plugin (skills, rules, MCP server), standard bug fix on the overdue filter. Create a private Linear team by hand, then run `stage-linear`.
4. **How do you parallelize a task?** — open a new agent, open the resolve-dispute plan, ledgerly-reviewer, dispatch-subagents skill, `/multitask`, Canvas subagent progress, ledgerly-reviewer check.

## Create the private Linear team (manual)

Linear MCP cannot create teams. Do this in the Linear UI **before** the 201 MCP section, on the operator’s account only.

1. Open Linear → **Settings → Teams → New team**.
2. Name it for this operator only (example: `{displayName}-field-demos`).
3. Turn on **Make team private**. Team key can be **LY**. Confirm it at `https://linear.app/<workspace>/settings/teams/LY`.
4. Members: **only you**. Do not add any other team.
5. Then ask an agent to run `stage-linear`. That skill creates or reconciles project `ce-field-demos` on this team with the three Fieldnote issues plus the nine Collections Command Center slices, tagged as that feature.

`stage-linear` never guesses the team — it lists your private teams and asks you to **confirm the exact one** before writing, so any team name works. `reset-demo-state` uses the same confirmation, then cancels the recorded issues and cancels the project (issues stay linked; your team is retained for the next run).

Do not skip the private-team step. A project on a public team is visible to that team.
During a fresh setup, create issues sequentially: suggested-credit first, **Clicking Overdue or Needs review does not filter the queue** second, and invoice-email third.

## Agents and skills

| Name | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `ledgerly-reviewer` | Read-only review after a change. Confirms the work runs, then catalog, seed names, planted seams, and high-risk changes. |
| `api-instrumenter` | One API route per parallel worker. |
| `dispute-verifier` | Dispute-resolution finish line. No product code. |
| `choose-cursor-workflow` | Walk the 101 or 201 track and pick the mode or model. |
| `plan-to-openspec` | Turn an explored feature into an OpenSpec change. Planning files only. |
| `stage-linear` | Reconcile Fieldnote issues on the private `ce-field-demos` Linear project. |
| `standard-bug-fix` | Pull one ce-field-demos Linear issue, then fix only that bug. |
| `dispatch-subagents` | Parallel Task launches. |
| `hand-to-cloud-agent` | Hand durable work to a Cloud Agent. |
| `autopilot` (built in) | Current PR-to-merge-ready skill; formerly `/babysit`. |
| `automate` (built in) | Draft a scheduled or event-triggered Grok Build Automation. |

## Notes

- Prices and customer names only from `lib/plans.ts`, `prisma/seed.ts`, and `prisma/extra-accounts.ts`.
- OpenSpec appears only in the last 101 beat. The change ends at the Linear ticket; do not implement, archive, or sync it unless the operator asks.
- Port 43173 busy: stop the old `npm run dev`. Empty dashboard: `npm run db:reset`.
