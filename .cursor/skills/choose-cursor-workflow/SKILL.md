# Walk the 101 or 201 track

The demo ships two jumpable tracks: **101** and **201**. Every beat is independent — if the user names a beat, jump directly to it. You still review the result.

## The tracks

101 — You will explore different ways to work in Grok Build, use modes and models for the right tasks, apply rules and skills to ensure consistent quality, and complete at least one task with an agent.

201 — You will curate what belongs in an agent's context, encode conventions as project skills, connect a curated set of MCP servers, and split one task across parallel agents.

The beats live in `lib/runbooks/meta.ts` and as copy-paste blocks on `/runbooks/101` and `/runbooks/201`. Use the matching `example` verbatim. Do not invent another catalog price.

The named demo error is `dsp_1043` / the suggested-credit v1 client. Do not mention the invoice or dispute filter-pill `state=` seam unless the user is on that click path.

Start a demo session with `npm run demo:session -- start`. Record every rule, skill, Canvas, OpenSpec change, Linear issue, and demo branch it creates. Reset is script-first and clears both tracks at once; update the event record and reset script whenever a beat gains a new leftover.

## 101 sections and beats

1. **What is Grok Build?** — Ask, Plan, Build in Agent mode, Debug, check the models, plan to fix the bug.
2. **How do I work with an agent?** — Run Mode allowlist, verify the email feature, redact, stop, interrupt and steer, continue to the end, review diffs, restore from a checkpoint.
3. **How do I govern my agent?** — create a user rule, test the rule, create a user skill, test the skill, Canvas, MCP / Linear in two steps: `/opsx-explore` the next feature, then `/opsx-propose resolve-dispute-panel` and file one Linear issue from it. The beat ends at the ticket.

## 201 sections and beats

1. **How do you manage context?** — rename agents, Ask DDD, check context usage, compare agents, ask across chats.
2. **How do you standardize agent behavior?** — personal create-api skill, promote it.
3. **How do you connect an agent to external tools?** — Linear MCP, MCP allowlist, list open issues from the issue tracker, add `plugins/standard-bug-fix` from the local repository, enable the Standard bug fix plugin (skills, rules, MCP server), standard bug fix on the overdue filter. The operator creates a private Linear team in the UI first (Settings → Teams → New team, Make team private). Then run `stage-linear`. `.cursor/mcp.json` has no project servers and there is no `mcp/` directory. Do not stand up a SQLite MCP.
4. **How do you parallelize a task?** — open a new agent, resolve-dispute plan, ledgerly-reviewer, dispatch-subagents skill, `/multitask`, Canvas subagent progress, ledgerly-reviewer check.

## Choose the mode

- **Ask** reads and explains; it does not edit. Use it to orient before touching code.
- **Plan** maps an approach before implementation.
- **OpenSpec** (last 101 beat) turns the next idea into a reviewable change: `/opsx-explore` thinks, `/opsx-propose` writes `openspec/changes/<id>/`, then the ticket goes to Linear.
- **Agent** is the default; it inspects, edits, and runs checks within the boundary you give it.
- **Debug** verifies a change and investigates failures.

## Choose the model

Use a high-reasoning model to plan and coordinate, and a faster model for narrow, well-scoped edits. On Teams and Enterprise, Auto (Grok Build Router) classifies each request for you. Pin a model when the role is already known.

## What does not change

The human reviews the result and decides what ships. Modes and models change how the work runs, not who is accountable.
