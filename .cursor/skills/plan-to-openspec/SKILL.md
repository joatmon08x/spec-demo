description: Turns a live openspec Linear issue or scoped request into an OpenSpec change after /opsx-explore. Do not use Cursor Plan mode.

# Explore, then OpenSpec

Planning artifacts only. Do not edit product code. Do not `/opsx-apply`. Stop after `openspec validate <name> --strict` passes.

Do not use Cursor Plan mode or `/plan`. Start with `/opsx-explore` (follow `.cursor/skills/openspec-explore/SKILL.md`). Then propose.

## Rough loop

Specs live in an openspec/ folder (what the system should do).
A change gets its own folder: proposal, design, tasks, delta specs.
In the AI assistant you run slash commands like /opsx:explore → /opsx:propose → /opsx:apply → /opsx:archive.
When done, the change archives and specs become the new source of truth.

Cursor Desktop spells those commands with hyphens: `/opsx-explore`, `/opsx-propose`, `/opsx-apply`, `/opsx-archive`.

## Input

Pick **one** source. Do not invent a fourth Fieldnote issue or a fourth catalog price.

1. A scoped request the user already explored with `/opsx-explore`.
2. A live issue from Linear project [openspec](https://linear.app/anysphere/project/openspec-05fc3d7dba89) (team `LY`). Use Linear MCP for **LY-6**, **LY-7**, or **LY-8**. Do not substitute stale local issue data or add a ticket board, ticket API, or ticket MCP.
3. If the user says “Linear” or “openspec project” and names no issue, ask which live issue to use. The `/runbooks/spec` demo uses LY-6.

Exact titles:

1. `Dispute dsp_1043 claims $400 against a $249 Scale invoice`
2. `Overdue / Needs review filter does not change the list`
3. `Change customer email on invoice detail`

Worked mappings: [examples.md](examples.md).

## Steps

1. Confirm `openspec/` exists (`openspec context --json`). If `no_openspec_root`, stop and tell the user to `openspec init`. Do not init automatically.
2. If explore has not run, run `/opsx-explore` on the request first. Do not skip to files.
3. Read `openspec/config.yaml` `context` and this repo’s catalog: Starter **$49**, Growth **$99**, Scale **$249**. Operator Avery Quinn. No real companies.
4. Derive a kebab-case change id from the issue slug or explored topic. Skip if `openspec/changes/<id>/` already exists unless the user asked to refresh it.
5. Follow `/opsx-propose` (or `openspec new change "<id>"` plus artifacts):
   - `proposal.md` — why, what, non-goals, capabilities
   - `specs/<capability>/spec.md` — ADDED/MODIFIED requirements with Given/When/Then
   - `design.md` — how, ownership, out of scope
   - `tasks.md` — checklist; one capability per isolated worker when work splits files
6. Copy acceptance, paths, and verification URLs from the live Linear issue description.
7. `openspec validate <id> --strict` and `openspec status --change <id>`. Report the change path. Do not implement.

## Constraints

- `dsp_1043` may claim $400 against Scale **$249**. Do not “correct” the claim or the seed. Stored credit on accept is **$249**.
- Do not edit `tests/suggested-credit-api.test.ts` to force green. Preserve v1 and v2 suggested-credit routes.
- Suggested-credit change: client to v2 only. Filter change: only filter selection. Email change: no email-format validation.
- Do not complete `lib/disputes/resolve.ts` unless the user asked to apply that change after propose.
- Do not archive. Specs become source of truth only after a later `/opsx-archive`.
- For any selected issue, partition responsibility between an implementation Cloud Agent and an independent verifier. For LY-6 specifically, do not invent a redundant test file; the existing regression test is the contract.
