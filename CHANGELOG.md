## [Unreleased]

### In progress

- **101 Plan beat on OpenSpec** — Plan is `/opsx-explore`, a new Propose beat is `/opsx-propose invoice-detail-email`, and Build in Agent mode is `/opsx-apply invoice-detail-email`. OpenSpec runs locally; Linear stays in 201. Adds `openspec/`, the `openspec-*` and `plan-to-openspec` skills, the `/opsx-*` commands, and `npm run openspec:validate`.
- **201 track** — Runbooks track `201` / `RUNBOOK_SECTIONS_201` is on main for CE workshop demos (Outline Show beats, Linear staging, disk plugin) but is not a formal release in this cut.
